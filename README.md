# Maze Assignment 3

## Description

This project allows the user to generate a maze. The maze is then solved by a maze-solving algorithm. The maze is solved automatically: a player displayed on the maze shows how the algorithm works.

There are two different ways to create mazes, and two different ways mazes can be solved.

To edit the code, make changes to the MazeApplication file. Go to the method displayTheMaze(). You can change which type of maze is generated, the size of the maze generated, and the algorithm used to solve the maze.
