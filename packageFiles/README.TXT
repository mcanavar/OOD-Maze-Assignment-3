You should create a new class that implements the RectMaze interface.

This new class should make use of your existing Maze project code.
This new class will serve as an ADAPTER between my graphics code and your existing code.

You should modify MazeApplication so that it uses your new Maze class instead of TestMaze.

When you are done, you should be able to compile the MazeApplication class and run the following command:
   java MazeApplication

This should display your Maze on the screen.
